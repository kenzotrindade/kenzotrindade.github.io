## 📋 About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, hosted via **GitHub Pages** as part of my curriculum at **Coda**. It serves as a central hub for my professional identity, showcasing my journey as a developer.

The main objective was to create a clean, responsive, and performant user interface that reflects my attention to detail and design.

> **Specific Goal:** Designing and deploying a live portfolio to showcase projects and contact information to the world.
